The goal of this project is to explore and represent the diversity in the fables of Jean de La Fontaine  by focusing on the poetic structure. Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695) was a French poet and fabulist, well known for his large collection of fables written in verse and often using animals to represent human traits. 

The corpus consists of three of his most famous fables : “Le Loup et l’Agneau” which addresses themes of power and injustice, "Le Chêne et le Roseau" which explores resilience and adaptability and "La Tortue et le Lièvre" which illustrates the virtues of perseverance and humility. 

In general, fables are written to convey moral lessons to the reader and the work of Jean de La Fontaine exemplifies this tradition. He even dedicates his collection to the Dauphin, the heir of the French throne, who was only seven at the time, to educate him about the world. Therefore, encoding this project in XML enables us to understand how La Fontaine used and adapted the structure of his fables to convey various morals. 

In this project, XML is primarily used to encode the formal elements of the fables, such as rhyme schemes, meter, caesuras, and monologues. This approach makes it easier to compare the different structures. Moreover, encoding the corpus in XML enables machine queries like searching for patterns and calculating percentages on the frequency of XML elements, which adds a level of precision that would be difficult to achieve through human observation. 

However, since this project's corpus consists only of three fables, the conclusions drawn cannot be considered definitive proof of the general writing style of La Fontaine. Instead, they will offer a preliminary idea of how he structures his fables.
